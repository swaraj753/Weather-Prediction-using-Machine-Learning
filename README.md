# Weather-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Project Steps:

Data Collection:
I've sourced a dataset containing historical weather information pertinent to my local area. This dataset includes essential features such as temperature, precipitation, and date/time details.

Data Cleaning and Visualization:
Once the dataset is obtained, I'll meticulously clean the data to address any inconsistencies, missing values, or anomalies. With the data primed for analysis, I'll leverage visualization techniques to gain insights into weather patterns, trends, and anomalies over time.

Building a Testing Framework:
To evaluate the performance of my predictive models, I'll establish a robust testing framework. This involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, defining appropriate evaluation metrics, and setting a clear cutoff point for separating historical data from future predictions.

Model Development and Enhancement:
With the testing framework in place, I'll start building predictive models using various machine learning algorithms. Initially, I'll develop a baseline model using simple techniques like linear regression or decision trees. As I progress, I'll explore advanced methods such as ensemble learning and deep learning to enhance prediction accuracy.

Optimization and Evaluation:
Throughout the process, I'll focus on optimizing the models by fine-tuning hyperparameters and incorporating additional predictors or features. Continuous evaluation using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) will guide me in assessing the model's performance and making necessary adjustments.

By meticulously following these steps, I aim to create a reliable system capable of accurately predicting tomorrow's temperature based on historical weather data specific to my location. This project not only serves as a practical application of machine learning but also offers valuable insights into weather forecasting and predictive analytics.
